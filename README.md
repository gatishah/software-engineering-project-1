software-engineering-project-1
==============================

Write a "single-page app" and develop its configuration management.

**Goal**: Gain experience with the following technologies:

[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), javascript, [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [bower](http://bower.io/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [d3](http://d3js.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

**Learning outcome**: Realize that most software engineering projects will require learning many technologies together.  Gain experience in using some technologies, such as grunt and bower, to help bridge the multiple technologies in a single process.
